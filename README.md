## Introduction

At Mansa, we are on a mission to make freelancers workers spend less time
on bureaucracies and more time using their money consciously, giving them
access to loans with lower interest rates and longer term. To achieve this,
we are developing a platform that involves the entire product chain and we
aim to become leaders in credit services in Europe.

To face this challenge, we need people who believe in the impact of our
business on one country's economy. More than that, we want to work with
people who are not content with the obvious, who participate, without being
afraid of making mistakes and learning, and who inspire others, with ideas
to simplify people's routine.

We provide you **3 different tests**:

-   [Backend Engineer](backend)
-   [Frontend Engineer](frontend)
-   [Data Scientist](datascience)

You'll learn more about the tasks we ask you to solve in their respective
`README.md` files.

Good luck! ðŸ’¥

## Delivery

We recommand you to create a private GitHub repository (GitHub can host
them for free!). After submission, one may tell you to add several persons
to your repository to review it properly.

<details>
<summary>You do not want to add us to your repository?</summary>

Git can create a standalone bundle of your repository containing all the
commit history:

```bash
git bundle create <yourname>.bundle --all
```

</details>

Feel free to add a `README.md` file explaining the decisions you've made
solving the tasks including technology and library choices, and instructions
required to run your solution and tests.

## Q&A

> Where should I send back the result when I'm done?

Fork this repo and send us a pull request when you think you are done. There
is no deadline for this task unless otherwise noted to you directly. You can
also directly send me your bundle at remy.tinco'@'getmansa'.com.

> There's something on the task I don't understand

If you have a doubt and can't reach us to clarify it, make the assumption that
feels more natural, document it and move on. We will evaluate based on that
assumption.

> Can I have some extra time to add more features ?

Adding extra features is great and we will look at them as well. But the
best thing you can do if you have extra time is to complete as much as you
can the features that are requested already. For example, try adding tests
or more documentation, we will value that more than having a user management
module.

> What if I have a question?

Just create a new issue in this repo and we will respond and get back to you
quickly. You can also send me an email remy.tinco'@'getmansa'.com. Asking
questions is good. We will not penalize you for asking questions.
